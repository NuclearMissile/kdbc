## Usage

To query or update a table you need a `Table` object that represents the database table.

```kotlin
class CUSTOMER : Table() {
    val id = column<Int>("id")
    val name = column<String>("name")
    val zip = column<String>("zip")
    val city = column<String>("city")
}
```

You will probably also have a corresponding domain object:

```kotlin
data class Customer(
    var id: Int,
    var name: String,
    var zip: String,
    var city: String
)
```

A Query is encapsulated in a class. Every table you mention in the
query needs an alias, defined by instantiating one or more `Table` instances.

You override the `get` function to tell the query how to turn a result set
into your domain object. You don't need to work with the `ResultSet` directly,
the table aliases can be used to extract the sql column values in a type safe manner.

```kotlin
class SelectCustomer : Query<Customer> {
    val c = CUSTOMER()

    init {
        select(c.id, c.name, c.zip, c.city)
        from(c)
    }

    override fun get() = Customer(c.id(), c.name(), c.zip(), c.city())
}
```

Notice how we call `alias.columnName()` to extract the value for the current column for the current row.

To execute the query you instantiate the query class and call one of the execute
actions `first()`, `firstOrNull()`, `list()`.

```kotlin
val allCustomers = SelectCustomer().list()
```

The query code we wrote in the init block can be reused for multiple queries. Let's add a `byId()` function to
our `SelectCustomer` query class:

```kotlin
fun byId(id: Int) = first {
    where {
        c.id `=` id
    }
}
```

We use the table alias `c` to construct the SQL `WHERE c.id = :id` in a type safe manner. We can now get a specific
customer:

```kotlin
val customer = SelectCustomer().byId(42)
```

### Insert and Update

These query classes normally takes one or more input parameters, and can extend `Insert`, `Update` or `Delete` instead
of `Query`. There really isn't
much of a difference, expect that the three first doesn't require a type parameter, like `Query` does.

The following `InsertCustomer` query takes a `customer` as a parameter, sets up a customer table alias and sets the name
column to the
name property of the input `Customer` object.

```kotlin
class InsertCustomer(customer: Customer) : Insert() {
    val c = CUSTOMER()

    init {
        insert(c) {
            c.name `=` customer.name
        }
        generatedKeys {
            customer.id = getInt(1)
        }
    }
}
```

The insert returns a generated key for the `id` column. This is the first and only generated key, and we assign it to
the `id` property of the input `Customer` object inside the `generatedKeys` block.
This block is consulted after the insert is executed:

```kotlin
InsertCustomer(customer).execute()
```

## Joins

Let's do a join! We'll introduce a `STATE` table and `State` domain object:

```kotlin
class STATE : Table() {
    val id = column<UUID>("id")
    val code = column<String>("code")
    val name = column<String>("name")
}

data class State(
    var id: UUID,
    var code: String,
    var name: String
)
```

We modify our Customer to include a state:

```kotlin
data class Customer(
    var id: Int,
    var name: String,
    var zip: String,
    var city: String,
    var state: State
)

class CUSTOMER : Table() {
    val id = column<Int>("id")
    val name = column<String>("name")
    val zip = column<String>("zip")
    val city = column<String>("city")
    val state = column<UUID>("state")
}
```

Let's modify our `SelectCustomer` query so it joins `State` and populates the complete `Customer`
together with the `State`. Notice that since we want all columns in both tables, we just
mention the alias once instead of mentioning all the columns.

```kotlin
class SelectCustomer : Query<Customer> {
    val c = CUSTOMER()
    val s = STATE()

    init {
        select(c, s)
        from(c)
        join(s) on {
            s.id `=` c.state
        }
    }

    override fun get() {
        val state = State(s.id(), s.code(), s.name())
        return Customer(c.id(), c.name(), c.zip(), c.city(), state)
    }
}
```

If you use `State` and/or `Customer` from other queries as well, consider
creating a secondary constructor that accepts the table object. That way the `get` mapper function would look like:

```kotlin
override fun get() = Customer(c, State(s))
```

This example showcases some of the corner stones of KDBC:

*You are 100% in control of what is fetched from your database, and you
construct your domain objects explicitly.*

## Custom column definitions

Let's revisit the first column we made, the `ID` property of our `CUSTOMER` table object:

```kotlin
class CUSTOMER : Table() {
    val id = column<Int>("id")
}
```

`getString()` operates on a `ResultSet` and `it` represents the column name.
When you don't supply a `getter` function, KDBC tries to do the right thing by using the `getXXX` function
of the `ResultSet` class, based on the type of the `column`. For example, a `column<Int>()` will
do `getInt(it)` and a `column<String>()` will do `getString(it)`. There are defaults for all known
SQL data types, but you can easily call any function on the `ResultSet` object if you have a custom
requirement.

## Dynamic queries

Some times you want to pass multiple parameters to a search function and some of them might be nullable.

Consider the following function that can search for customers with a certain name, and optionally of atleast a given
age.

```kotlin
fun search(name: String, minAge: Int?) = list {
    where {
        upper(c.name) like upper("%$name%")
        if (minAge != null) {
            and {
                c.age gte minAge
            }
        }
    }
}

```

> Yes, `name` is parameterized in the underlying prepared statement. SQL injection is not welcome here! :)

## DDL

The `column()` delegate also takes an optional `ddl` parameter. This is a string that can be used to
generate DDL, which can be automatically executed to create your database table.

The following example is taken from the test suite of KDBC:

```kotlin
class CUSTOMER : Table() {
    val id = column<Int>("id", "integer not null primary key auto_increment")
    val name = column<String>("name", "text")
}
```

> Customer definition with DDL

The DDL is then used when the test suite fires up:

```kotlin
val dataSource = JdbcDataSource()
dataSource.setURL("jdbc:h2:mem:test;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1")
KDBC.setDataSource(dataSource)
CUSTOMER().create()
```

A `DataSource` is generated and configured as the default data source via `KDBC.setDataSource()`. Then
we call `CUSTOMER().create()`, which generates the DDL and executes it to construct our table.

## Connection handling

For simple use against a single database, calling `KDBC.setDataSource` might be fine. There are more advanced strategies
for choosing the connection
on a per query basis as well.

### Query.connection()

Every `Query` instance has a setter called `connection(connection)` which will configure the connection to be used for
the query.

```kotlin
InsertCustomer(customer).connection(connection).execute()
```

> Specify connection explicitly per query

`Query` also takes an optional connection parameter in its constructor as an alternative:

```kotlin
InsertCustomer(connection, customer).execute()
```

> Connection specified in query constructor

### Connection factory

The connection factory is in charge of supplying a connection to any Query that hasn't been assigned a connection as
execution time.
`KDBC.setDataSource()` actually calls `KDBC.setConnectionFactory` under the covers. It's implementation is simple:

```kotlin
fun setDataSource(dataSource: DataSource) {
    setConnectionFactory { dataSource.connection }
}
```

The function passed to `setConnectionFactory` receives the query as it's single argument and is required to return a
connection. The
following implementation inspects an annotation set on each query and assigns a connection based on that:

```kotlin
@Target(AnnotationTarget.CLASS)
annotation class Database(val pool: String)

KDBC.setConnectionFactory { query ->
    val db = query.javaClass.getAnnotation(Database::class.java)
    when (db.pool) {
        "pool1" -> pool1.connection
        "pool2" -> pool2.connection
        else -> throw IllegalArgumentException("Don't know how to create connection for pool ${db.pool}")
    }
}
```

This is merely a suggestion and you can use whatever strategy you like, for example by inspecting the package the Query
is in or even the presence of an interface etc.

## Transactions

If the current connection has `autoCommit = true`, each query will be committed upon completion. This is the default for
a manually created
`java.sql.Connection`. A connection pool may change this behavior. For example, a JavaEE application will control
transactions according to
the JavaEE life cycle.

KDBC has means to manually control the transaction context as well. To run multiple queries in the same transactions,
wrap them in a `transaction` block:

```kotlin
transaction {
    CreateCustomer(customer).execute()
    CreateOrder(order).execute()
}
```

To create a new connection that will participate in the same transaction, nest another `transaction` block inside the
existing one.

The `transaction` block takes an optional `transactionType` parameter.

This is by default set to `TransactionType.REQUIRED` which indicates that the transaction can participate in an already
active transaction or create it's own if no transaction is active.

Changing to TransactionType.REQUIRES_NEW will temporarily suspend any active transactions and resume them after the code
inside the `transaction` block completes.

If no connection is specified for the queries inside the block, the connection retrieved for the first query executed
inside the transaction block will be used for all subsequent queries.

## Batch statements

If your database supports it, you can do batch updates or inserts just by wrapping the code in `batch` and give it a
list of objects to iterate over as it's single argument:

```kotlin
class InsertCustomersInBatch(customers: List<Customer>) : Insert() {
    val c = CUSTOMER()

    init {
        batch(customers) { customer ->
            insert(c) {
                c.name `=` customer.name
            }
            // If database supports generated keys, retrieve them here
            generatedKeys {
                customer.id = getInt(1)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Textual SQL

If you come across an unsupported native SQL command or for some other reason need to enter arbitrary SQL, you can use
the `append` call or simply `+`:

```kotlin
+ "custom sql here"
```

## Adding native support for new syntax

It is pretty easy to extend the framework to support custom native SQL commands. There are two steps to it:

1. Extend the `Expr` class
2. Define a function to create the Expr class

Take a look in [expression.kt](https://github.com/edvin/kdbc/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/kdbc/expression.kt) to see how
the existing expressions are implemented.
