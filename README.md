# SQL DSL for Kotlin

KDBC provides type safe SQL queries for Kotlin. Features:

- 100% control of executed SQL
- Column selections and joins can be easily reused for multiple queries
- Explicit, but convenient O/R mapping
- Optional DDL generation

To query or update a table you need a `Table` object that represents the database table.

```kotlin
class CUSTOMER : Table {
    val ID by column<Int>()
    val NAME by column<String>()
    val ZIP by column<String>()
    val CITY by column<String>()
}
```

You will probably also have a corresponding domain object:

```kotlin
data class Customer(
    var id: Int,
    var name: String,
    var zip: String,
    var city: String
)
```


A Query is encapsulated in a class. Every table you mention in the
query needs an alias, defined by instantiating one or more `Table` instances.

You override the `rowItem` function to tell the query how to turn a result set
into your domain object. You don't need to work with the `ResultSet` directly,
the table aliases can be used to extract the sql columns in a type safe manner.

```kotlin
class SelectCustomer : Query<Customer> {
    val C = CUSTOMER()

    init {
        SELECT(C.ID, C.NAME, C.ZIP, C.CITY)
        FROM(C)
    }

    override fun rowItem() = Customer(C.ID(), C.NAME(), C.ZIP(), C.CITY())
}
```

Notice how we call `alias.columnName()` to extract the value for the current column for the current row.

To execute the query you instantiate the query class and call one of the execute actions (`first()`, `firstOrNull()`, `list()`)

```kotlin
val allCustomers = SelectCustomer().list()
```

The query code we wrote in the init block can be reused for multiple queries. Let's add a `byId()` function to our `SelectCustomer` query class:

```kotlin
fun byId(id: Int) = first {
    WHERE {
        C.ID `=` id
    }
}
```

We use the table alias (`C`) to construct the SQL `WHERE c.id = :id` in a type safe manner. We can now get a specific customer:

```kotlin
val customer = SelectCustomer().byId(42)
```

Let's do a join! We'll introduce a `STATE` table and `State` domain object:

```kotlin
class STATE : Table() {
    val ID by column<UUID>()
    val CODE by column<String>()
    val NAME by column<String>()
}

data class State(
    var id: UUID,
    var code: String,
    var name: String
)
```

We modify our `Customer` to include a `State`:

```kotlin
data class Customer(
    var id: Int,
    var name: String,
    var zip: String,
    var city: String,
    var state: State
)
```

Let's modify our `SelectCustomer` query so it joins `State` and populates the complete `Customer`
together with the `State`. Notice that since we want all columns in both tables, we just
mention the alias once instead of mentioning all the columns.

```kotlin
class SelectCustomer : Query<Customer> {
    val C = CUSTOMER()
    val S = STATE()

    init {
        SELECT(C, S)
        FROM(C)
        JOIN (S) ON {
            S.ID `=` C.STATE
        }
    }

    override fun rowItem() {
        val state = State(S.ID(), S.CODE(), S.NAME())
        return Customer(C.ID(), C.NAME(), C.ZIP(), C.CITY(), state)
    }
}
```

This example showcases some of the corner stones of KDBC:

*You are 100% in control of what is fetched from your database, and you
construct your domain objects explicitly.*

## Custom column definitions

Let's revisit the first column we made, the `ID` property of our `CUSTOMER` table object:

```kotlin
class CUSTOMER : Table {
    val ID by column<Int>()
}
```

We have seen that the `Table` objects can retrieve values from our `ResultSet`, but how exactly does it work?

The `column()` delegate function above can take an optional `getter` function that tells KDBC how to extract
the column value for a given `ResultSet` object. The `getter` function operates on a `ResultSet` and is passed
the column name. Therefore, the `ID` column could also have been constructed like this:

```kotlin
val ID by column { getString(it) }
```

`getString()` operates on a `ResultSet` and `it` represents the column name.
When you don't supply a `getter` function, KDBC tries to do the right thing by using the `getXXX` function
of the `ResultSet` class, based on the type of the `column`. For example, a `column<Int>()` will
do `getInt(it)` and a `column<String>()` will do `getString(it)`. There are defaults for all known
SQL data types, but you can easily call any function on the `ResultSet` object if you have a custom
requirement.

### DDL

The `column()` delegate also takes an optional `ddl` parameter. This is a string that can be used to
generate DDL, which can be automatically executed to create your database table.

The following example is taken from the test suite of KDBC:

```kotlin
class CUSTOMER : Table("customer") {
    val ID by column<Int>("integer not null primary key auto_increment")
    val NAME by column<String>("text")
}
```
> Customer definition with DDL

The DDL is then used when the test suite fires up:

```kotlin
val dataSource = JdbcDataSource()
dataSource.setURL("jdbc:h2:mem:test;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1")
KDBC.setDataSource(dataSource)
CUSTOMER().create()
```

A `DataSource` is generated and configured as the default data source via `KDBC.setDataSource()`. Then
we call `CUSTOMER().create()`, which generates the DDL and executes it to construct our table.
